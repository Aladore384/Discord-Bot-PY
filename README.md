Discord Bot PY

This is a Discord Bot offering basic moderation, role management and fun features.

My first time ever coding anything, and I used AIs to do most of the work.
I also talked with various more experienced friends for input.
And then I edited stuff based on hunchs, trying to figure it out through trial and error.

Good thing is, it somehow works as intended!

I am posting it here for two reasons:
1. Allow anyone to use it for their server, using their own token (and thus their own custom name and avatar).
2. Work as a community to improve and/or expand the code.
